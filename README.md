# move_to_code_onboarding
A repository to contain Radhika's unity onboarding experimentation.

## What's done so far
* Block that spawns new blocks when selected. Dragging the block away from the original "menu item" block by a certain distance allows the block to stay, while it gets deleted if it stays within that distance from the "menu item" block

## What needs to be done
* Change the code so that it uses "OnCollisionExit" rather than a hard-coded distance from the menu
* Create a shelf at the bottom of the screen to house "menu blocks" with different tabs that can light up / go gray on a certain condition

## How to run
* Download "Unity Hub" and set up Unity v 2018.4.21
* Clone this repository and select the directory in the "add" option on Unity Hub
* Click the listing called "move_to_code_onboarding" to open the project in Unity!
